CTCI 2.5

I: Reverse add elements in a linked list 

D: The solution looks like an integer response with the amount of numbers as that in the stack.

E: We can accomplish this by traversing the nodes and adding the elements within

A:
	Step 1 & 2: I wrote down partial information on a whiteboard to visualize the problem.
	Step 3: I noticed a pattern in that we would need to iterate through the lists to add their elements.

	Step 4, 5, 6: I did not know where to begin with this problem and ended up turning to the Internet for help in solving the problem.

L: This problem was tough to solve, as I do not remember stacks very well. The solution used was a combination of help from classmates although I still do not completely understand it myself.
