CTCI 2.2

I: Find the nth to last element of a singly linked list 

D: The solution looks like a single response of what the position is

E: We can accomplish this by using a temporary node to help as we shift the order of the linked lists.

A:
	Step 1 & 2: I wrote down partial information on a whiteboard to visualize the problem.
	Step 3: I noticed no patterns when attempting to solve this problem. 

	Step 4, 5, 6: I decided to iterate though the LinkedList and compare each element's data to the search value and in doing so, am able to find the element with the data.

L: This problem was easier than the previous problem, given that it was a simple looping problem. It was nice to understand a linked list problem.
