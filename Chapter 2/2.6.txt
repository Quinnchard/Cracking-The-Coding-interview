CTCI 2.6

I: Determine if a linked list is a palindrome.

D: The solution looks like an boolean response.

E: We can accomplish this by traversing and reversing the linked list

A:
	Step 1 & 2: I wrote down partial information on a whiteboard to visualize the problem.
	Step 3: I noticed a pattern in that we would need to iterate through the lists to add their elements.

	Step 4, 5, 6: I did not know where to begin with this problem and ended up working with classmates to solve this problem.

L: This problem is instilling in me that I need to consider reviewing linked lists.
