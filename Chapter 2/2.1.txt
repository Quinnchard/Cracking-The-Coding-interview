CTCI 2.1

I: Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list

D: The solution looks like a linked list rendered in ascending order

E: We can accomplish this by using a temporary node to help as we shift the order of the linked lists.

A:
	Step 1 & 2: I wrote down partial information on a whiteboard to visualize the problem.
	Step 3: A pattern noticed was that since we'd be using temporary nodes, we would need to loop through the original linked list to create the new list

	Step 4, 5, 6: In choosing to use temporary nodes, and getting stuck on using linked lists, it soon became possible to orient the temporary and head in such a way that it organized the list

L: I was stuck on this problem for a few hours because I haven't used linked lists since my elementary data structures class. It's evident I need to relearn this
