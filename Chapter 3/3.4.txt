CTCI 3.4

I: Create a Queue Class

D: The solution looks like a class that created a Queue using two stacks

E: We can accomplish this by expanding on the Stacks class we have from our original Node class

A:
	Step 1 & 2: I drew partial information on a whiteboard to visualize the problem.

	Step 3: I did not notice any patterns.

	Step 4, 5, 6: I did not know where to begin with this problem and ended up working with classmates to solve this problem.

L: I am embarrassed to say that I am a CS major who forgot how to implement Stacks and Queues.
