CTCI 1.1

I: Design a way to figure out if a String's characters are all unique.

D: The solution looks like a binary response of whether or not the String's characters are unique

E: We can accomplish this by using a Boolean variable that returns a true/false response and implement this in one method or gather the string in one method and use a separate method to determine if the String's characters are unique. Alternatively, the use of a set would be helpful as only unique variables are needed for this problem.

A:
	Step 1 & 2: I wrote down partial information on a whiteboard to visualize the problem.
	Step 3: A pattern noticed was that a trigger would be needed for every unique character spotted. Another pattern is that since we need to evaluate each character uniquely, we'd have to loop through the solution. 
	Step 4, 5, 6: Running multiple tests after translating to code identified a few unique instances where the ideas did not ideally transfer to reality. For example, a boolean trigger was initialized to the wrong instance, causing test cases that would've otherwise failed to pass and vise versa.

L: I learned a little bit more about implementing HashSets to identify unique instances inside of strings.
