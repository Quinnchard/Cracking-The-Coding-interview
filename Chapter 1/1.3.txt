I: Replace all spaces in a String with a "%20"

D: The solution looks like a String of words with no spaces, rather "%20" in their stead.

E: We can accomplish this by traversing through the String and checking if each character is a space or not, then replace the spaces with "%20." Alternatively, we could use the .replaceAll() method from Java to replace all spaces with "%20."

A:
	Step 1 & 2: I wrote down partial information on a whiteboard to visualize the problem.
	Step 3: A pattern noticed was that a flag would be needed for every space ( ) that was spotted. Another pattern is that since we need to evaluate each character uniquely, we'd have to loop through the solution. 
	Step 4, 5, 6: In choosing to use the .replaceAll() method in Java, running multiple tests after translating to code identified no errors.

L: I learned that I under certain assumptions, I could use "shortcuts" in a programming language to solve problems more efficiently, i.e. Java libraries
